# Lesson 8: Introduction to DB

1. **SQL-based relational databases**: These databases use SQL as their primary query language and 
follow the relational model, which organizes data into tables with well-defined relationships between them. 
Examples of SQL-based relational databases include _MySQL_, _PostgreSQL_, _Microsoft SQL Server_, and _Oracle_.
2. **Non-SQL relational databases**: These databases also follow the relational model but do not use SQL 
as their primary query language. Instead, they may use alternative query languages or proprietary query languages. 
Examples of non-SQL relational databases include _IBM DB2_, _Informix_, and _Teradata_.
3. **NoSQL databases**: databases are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data and 
often use alternative data models, such as key-value, document-oriented, or graph databases. 
Examples of NoSQL databases include _MongoDB_, _Cassandra_, and _Neo4j_.

## SQL

SQL is a programming language designed to interact with relational databases, 
allowing users to **store**, **update**, **remove**, **search**, and **retrieve** information from these databases. 
It is a standardized language, meaning that it is widely accepted and used across various platforms and systems.

**Key Features**:

- **Declarative language**: SQL is a declarative language, meaning that you specify what you want to do with your data, 
rather than how to do it.
- **Query language**: SQL is a query language, allowing you to ask questions about the data in your database.
- **Relational database management**: SQL is designed to work with relational databases, which store data in tables 
with defined relationships between them.
- **Static, strong typing**: SQL has a static, strong typing system, which means that the data types of 
variables are known at compile time.

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
	isbn		char(14) NOT NULL,
	title	 varchar(255) NOT NULL,
	author	varchar(255) NOT NULL,
	price	 decimal(5,2) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO books (isbn, title, author, price) VALUES
('978-1503261969', 'Emma', 'Jayne Austen', 9.44),
('978-1505255607', 'The Time Machine', 'H. G. Wells', 5.99),
('978-1503379640', 'The Prince', 'Niccolò Machiavelli', 6.99);

ALTER TABLE books ADD PRIMARY KEY (isbn);
```

## SQL in Go

To access databases in Go, you use a `sql.DB`. You use this type to create statements and transactions, 
execute queries, and fetch results.

The first thing you should know is that a `sql.DB` isn’t a database connection. 
It also doesn’t map to any particular database software’s notion of a “database” or “schema.” 
It’s an abstraction of the interface and existence of a database, which might be as varied as a local file, 
accessed through a network connection, or in-memory and in-process.

`sql.DB` performs some important tasks for you behind the scenes:

- It opens and closes connections to the actual underlying database, via the driver. 
- It manages a pool of connections as needed, which may be a variety of things as mentioned.

The `sql.DB` abstraction is designed to keep you from worrying about how to manage concurrent 
access to the underlying datastore. A connection is marked in-use when you use it to perform a task, 
and then returned to the available pool when it’s not in use anymore. 
One consequence of this is that if you fail to release connections back to the pool, 
you can cause sql.DB to open a lot of connections, potentially running out of 
resources (too many connections, too many open file handles, lack of available network ports, etc). 
We’ll discuss more about this later.

After creating a `sql.DB`, you can use it to query the database that it represents, 
as well as creating statements and transactions.
